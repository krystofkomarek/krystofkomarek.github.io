    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>Definitions</h2>
    <p><strong>Application</strong> refers to the SentientNote application for iOS, the SentientNote application for
        Android, and the SentientNote application for desktop platforms; published by SentientNote company;</p>
    <p><strong>Company</strong> (referred to as either "the Company", “Our”, “Us” or "We" in this privacy policy) refers
        to SentientNote company, whose head office is at some random address.</p>
    <p><strong>Service</strong> means - “VoIP service for calls, instant messaging and collaboration” provided via the
        Application</p>
    <p><strong>Personal Data</strong> is any information that specifically identifies an individual (such as your name,
        user name, address, or e-mail address), processed by the Company for the purposes set forth in this privacy
        policy. Personal Data also includes any information about an individual that is directly linked to personally
        identifiable information and is processed by the Company for the purposes set forth in this privacy policy.
        Personal information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data the Company collects about the use
        of the Service (such as automated crash reports) or about a group or category of users, from which individual
        identities or other personal information has been removed. This privacy policy in no way restricts or limits our
        collection and use of aggregate information.</p>

    <h2>Privacy information access preface</h2>
    <p>Company is very concerned for the privacy of the users of our products. To this extent, no user information is
        collected except when necessary for using a specific feature of our products (Apple Push Notification Service,
        Firebase Cloud Messaging) and is never shared with any third parties. The only time information is requested
        other than listed here is for use in troubleshooting technical issues, and of course, the user has the option to
        refuse in that case (though that may negatively affect our ability to resolve any issues).</p>
    <p>This privacy policy contains the full list of features built into the Application that in any way process users’
        private information. Whether a feature is enabled or not, and thus whether the private information required for
        the feature to work is accessed, depends solely on the SIP account configuration in the Application.</p>

    <h2>Push Notifications</h2>
    <p>In order for Push Notifications to work, we must register your account remotely when the Application is in the
        background or closed on your iOS or Android device. To accomplish this, we transmit your SIP account details to
        SIPIS (our server that handles push notifications) over an HTTPS – secure connection. This information is shared
        with no one and is erased immediately when the push instance expires (usually within 3-6 days, depending on SIP
        account configuration) or the user disables Push Notifications in the Application. If the SIP account is
        configured to use one of our methods for multitasking instead of Push Notifications, this information is not
        sent to SIPIS.</p>

    <h2>Mobile App Contacts Usage</h2>
    <p>This part of the privacy statement describes how the Company collects and uses the contact information you
        provide by granting the contacts access permission in the Application. It also describes the choices available
        to you regarding our use of your information and how you can access and update this information.</p>

    <p>This part of the privacy statement describes how the Company uses the location information you provide by
        granting the Location access permission in the Application.</p>

        use cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When the SIP account is used in a country with Dispatchable Location for emergency calls legal requirement.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Mobile App Media Files and Documents usage</h2>
    <p>This part of the privacy statement describes how the Company uses media files and documents shared with the
        Application. Depending on the operating system, you may need to grant additional file access-related permissions
        to the Application in order for the Application to access files.</p>
    <p>We process your files such as photos, videos, and documents; only if the SIP account is configured to do so, and
        only in the following use cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When you select the option to share a media or file attachment via a multimedia message.</li>

        Calendar account via the Application for our UCaaS products. It also describes the choices available to you
        regarding our use of your information and how you can access and update this information.</p>

        other network in-app events generated by user activity.</p>

        We may also maintain this information for a period of time after you are no longer a customer if the information
        is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or to satisfy our legal requirements and/or
